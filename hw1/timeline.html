    <h2>Rise of the Big Five</h2>

    <p>
        The rise of the big five has not been instantaneous, yet it is remarkable how many
        advances have been made and the acceleration of each company over time. They 
        each sprouted ideas into large services that have remained industry standard, and 
        monopolize the digital landscape.

            <li> <b>Google</b>
                The Google search engine launched in 1998, and since its beginning it has launched
                several other core services. In 2006, Google acquired YouTube, and over time, it has
                had many acquisitions focused on AI, hardware, and robotics.
            </li>
            <li> <b>Apple</b>
                In 2012, acquired Authentec, enabling TouchID/biometric authentication.
                They also made groundbreaking innovations with its chip-design in 2018.
            </li>
            <li> <b>Meta</b>
                Founded in 2004, Meta has grown at an unprecedented pace.
                Meta has made several key plays, such as purchasing Instagram in 2012, 
                WhatsApp in 2014, and that same year purchasing Oculus to enter the virutal
                reality and metaverse spaces.
            </li>
            <li> <b>Amazon</b>
                Originating as online retailer, Amazon has expanded to AWS, then into streaming
                (through Twitch), and overall creating a large work environment.
            </li>
            <li> <b>Microsoft</b>
                Although Microsoft began its dominance with Windows/Office, it now has large
                acquisitions in dev tools (GitHub), healthcare (Nuance), and gaming (Activision/
                Blizzard/Xbox).
            </li>
