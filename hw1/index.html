    <p>
        The “Big Five” refers to the top five tech companies in the United States:
      Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Apple, Meta (Facebook), and Microsoft. This group goes by several acronyms, such as
      <abbr title="Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta">GAMAM</abbr>,
      <abbr title="Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft">GAFAM</abbr>, and
      <abbr title="Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google">FAAMG</abbr>.
      These companies are among the most influential globally, just behind <mark>NVIDIA</mark>, which currently stands as the world’s largest company.
      Combined, the Big Five hold a market capitalization of more than $14.5 trillion as of mid-September 2025.
    </p>

    <p>The companies and their approximate market caps are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Microsoft:</b> $3.8 trillion</li>
        <li><b>Apple:</b> $3.5 trillion</li>
        <li><b>Alphabet (Google):</b> $2.9 trillion</li>
        <li><b>Amazon:</b> $2.9 trillion</li>
        <li><b>Meta (Facebook):</b> $2.4 trillion</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The Big Five have amassed such high value not only due to their massive market
        value and user bases, but also for the extensive range of sectors these companies
        are involved in, from healthcare to social media to digital infrastructure.
