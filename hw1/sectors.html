    <h2>Sectors that GAFAM Operate In</h2>

    <p>When thinking of each of these companies, one might initially think of
        the Google Chrome browser for Google, Amazon for online shopping, Meta
        for Facebook, and the like. In reality, each of these companies have a
        much broader scope. Over time, they have entered several diverse areas, 
        such as healthcare, advertising, computing, education, and beyond.
    </p>

    <h2>Some Sector Examples</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li> <b>Social Media and Communiation:</b>
                Meta owns several communication and media platforms, such as
                WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger.
                Google acquired YouTube and Wazeâ€”a community-driven navigation
                platform.
            </li>
            <li> <b>IT and Technology:</b>
                Amazon owns Amazon Web Services (AWS), providing cloud computing,
                storage, serverless platforms for any external business. Microsoft
                Azure plays a similar role for Microsoft. Microsoft also owns
                GitHub, the current industry standard for developers
                and open-source initiatives. 
            </li>
            <li> <b>Health:</b>
                GAFAM has several health-related aquisitions, software for medical
                records, wellness tools, and the like. One example is Rosetta
                Biosoftware, owned by Microsoft, which has expanded the capabilities
                of drug discovery and general biological research.
            </li>
            <li> <b>Gaming:</b>
                Although YouTube, owned by Google, can be seen as a media platform,
                it also crosses into the entertainment and gaming sector. There is
                also Amazon with Twitch, Meta with virtual reality Oculus entertainment,
                and Microsoft owning Xbox and Xbox Cloud Gaming.
            </li>
            <br>
            <br>
            There are several other sectors, shown in the diagram below, such as ecommerce,
            consumer electronics, robotics, and several others. Many of the platforms or 
            tools owned by the Big Five span several sectors. Take a look at the "Technologies"
            page to see what techonologies underpin all these sectors.
